## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Error-severity diagnostics floor decision at ask

The evaluator SHALL set the final decision to at least `:ask` whenever
`ParseResult.diagnostics` contains any `Error`-severity items, regardless of
what the rule evaluation produced.

When the floor applies, the reason SHALL be a single line of the form

```
parse error: <kind message> at line L, column C: '<excerpt>'
```

derived from the first `Error`-severity `ParseDiagnostic` in the parse
result. `<kind message>` SHALL be the diagnostic's `message()`. `L` and `C`
SHALL be 1-based line and column numbers computed from `span.start` against
the original input. `<excerpt>` SHALL be a short source window around
`span.start` with control characters escaped and truncated content
ellipsised on either side. Cascading diagnostics (later error-severity
entries) SHALL NOT appear in the reason; they remain available via
`EvalResult.parse_diagnostics`.

#### Scenario: Allowed command with parse error

- **WHEN** the input is `echo "hello; rm -rf /`
- **AND** `echo` is allowed
- **THEN** the decision SHALL be `:ask` (not `:allow`)
- **AND** the reason SHALL start with `parse error: unterminated double quote`
- **AND** the reason SHALL contain `line 1, column 6`

#### Scenario: Denied command with parse error

- **WHEN** the input is `rm "unterminated`
- **AND** `rm` is denied
- **THEN** the decision SHALL be `:deny` (floor is `:ask`, but `:deny` > `:ask`)

#### Scenario: Warning-only diagnostics do not affect decision

- **WHEN** the input is `if true; then echo hello`
- **AND** `echo` is allowed
- **THEN** the decision SHALL be `:allow` (missing `fi` is Warning, not Error)

#### Scenario: Reason names the kind, location, and excerpt

- **WHEN** the input is a multi-line command whose first error-severity
  diagnostic is an unterminated single quote on line 3 at column 42
- **THEN** the reason SHALL match the shape
  `parse error: unterminated single quote at line 3, column 42: '<excerpt>'`
- **AND** the excerpt SHALL include source content surrounding `span.start`
- **AND** control characters in the excerpt SHALL be escaped (e.g. `\n`)

#### Scenario: Cascading diagnostics suppressed in reason

- **WHEN** the input produces multiple error-severity diagnostics from a
  single root cause (e.g. a stray `'` that also unterminates subsequent
  backticks)
- **THEN** the reason SHALL describe only the first diagnostic
- **AND** all diagnostics SHALL still appear in `EvalResult.parse_diagnostics`
